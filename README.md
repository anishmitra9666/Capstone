Looked at if American states which lose a significant quantity of jobs during a recession tend to have most of these voters change party affiliation to Republican.
We hypothesized significant job loss in a state would make the states overall political ideology more conservative.
This hypothesis was correct and we were also able to reject the null hypothesis at the 5%, 1% and 0.1% levels.
